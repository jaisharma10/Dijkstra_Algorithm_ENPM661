1) run the file 'jaisharm_P2_Dijkstra.ipynb'
2) the file includes a 'main' function that calls several other subfunctions
3) the program requires user to enter 4 inputs: Xi, Yi, Xg, Yg  
4) the program can take between 5 to 15 minutes to run. 
	- most test cases took about 6 minutes on my computer.
    	- the code prints the runtime for reference
5) visualizating the code is done as follows:
	- cv2 library is used to get images of the Map, Visited Nodes and the Path
	- pygame lirary is leveraged to display the path finding Algorithm
